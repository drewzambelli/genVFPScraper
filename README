Tek-tips scraper targetting foxpro forum threads
When run, see line 16 and line 144 to change pages it pulls - ie changed start_page and end_page
to pages where you want to start and end.
Also, see line 8 BASE_URL variable - change page number to where you want to start.
Then just run as normal python program from terminal: 'python vfp_scrap.py'
Currently, scraped up to page 1469.
Files stored off into CSV and JSON.
Keep in mind, no failure handling written into code so if request times out, website crashes,
or internet fails - the program fails and you lose everything you've scraped (writing only
occurs at very end). I suggest you scrape a couple hundred pages at a time.
